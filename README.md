# PGM Image Manipulator

## Overview
This project is a Python-based tool for manipulating PGM (Portable GrayMap) image files. It provides a variety of image processing functionalities such as flipping, cropping, inverting, and compressing images.

## Features
- **Flip**: Horizontally or vertically mirror images.
- **Crop**: Trim images to a specified size or region.
- **Invert**: Invert the color scheme to create a negative of the image.
- **Compress**: Apply run-length encoding to compress images without losing quality.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Understanding of file I/O and string manipulation in Python.

## Usage
Each functionality is accessible via a clearly defined function within the script. Functions are documented with docstrings, including examples for ease of use.

To process an image, simply run the script with the desired function and provide the image file as an argument.
